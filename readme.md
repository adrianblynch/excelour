# Excelour

A Hapi based API for generating Excel documents.

This is a project to aid the teaching of Node and Hapi to colleagues.

## Notes

- It has been "tested" on Node 4.x.x
- It is far from best practice
- - The queue is in memory (at least for now)
- - I use sync methods to ease coding
- - Both the API, polling code and excel generation is all bundled together
